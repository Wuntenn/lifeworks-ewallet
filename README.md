I think I was a bit too ambitious with the setup,

I realised that I don't actually haven a starting point for small projects. I spent most of the time
during this test on the unmarked/unseen area and punishing myself with errors.

I had intended to go above and beyond, however I don't have time to:

- Add the validation; 
- Add the unit tests; **or**
- Add the easter-egg :(

I hope from this work so far that you're able to see how I work.

I welcome any feedback.

Kind regards,

Daron Jones
